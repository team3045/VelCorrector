# Velocity Correction
A small webapp created to demonstrate robot shooting capabilities.

## How to use
Launch the webapp either on your own device via:

```streamlit run .\VeloCorrector\Webview.py```

Alternatively, you should be able to go to https://3045velocitycorrector.streamlit.app/

Finally, input your variables:  
Position, Velocity, Target Position, and angle

The app should spit out the other variables:  
Vertical angle, horizontal angle, time of flight
